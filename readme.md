# node-project-template

My custom template for a new node.js project featuring my lint config and devDependencies

## How to use

Just clone this repository and in a terminal run the script `start.sh` to initialize git to an empty repository and install every npm module defined in `package.json`.
`start.sh` will be deleted if everything executed without issues.

If you need to give executable permissions to `start.sh` run `chmod +x start.sh`.

**Remember to edit this `readme.md` and `package.json` with your project info.**
